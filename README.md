# Hi, I'm Monish

I’ve worked as a Customer Relationship Executive, where I handled service requests, coordinated with field teams, and ensured SLA-based resolutions. I also managed escalations and tracked follow-ups, often using Excel and shift schedules to organize tasks.

This GitHub is my small step into learning more about digital tools, automation, and how platforms like this can help even in customer-facing roles. Right now, I’m pursuing my BBA through distance education and open to new opportunities in customer success, support, or operations roles.

Thanks for stopping by!
